<h1>The Best Movies of All Time According to Alina</h1>
<h2>My top movies of all time</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>Dune: Part 1</h3>
<p>It has blown my mind and replaced Star Wars movies from my favourite list - forgive me, Star Wars fans!</p>
<h3>Dune: Part 2</h3>
<p>Mindblowing storyline. Outstanding shots in the desert. Images and silence are worth more than thousands of words.</p>
<h3>Hable Con Ella</h3>
<p>The movie that made me fall in love with Pedro Almodovar's cinematography.</p>
