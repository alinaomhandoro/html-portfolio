<h1>About Me</h1>

<h2>"Even sky it's not the limit!"</h2>

<p>After two decades of experience in customer relations, translation, content management, recruitment and training, 
  I decided it was time for new challenges and a career change.</p>

<p>I looked into web development and AWS Cloud and decided to dive into both! Here, you can find my first projects 
  created on my web development journey.</p>
